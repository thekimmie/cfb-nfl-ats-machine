# predict.py
"""
Contract:
- Expose: def predict_games(games: list[dict]) -> list[dict]
- Each input game contains: league, game_time, home_team, away_team,
  sportsbook_spread, sportsbook_total, sportsbook_ml_odds_home, sportsbook_ml_odds_away
- We return those join fields + model fields: model_ml_prob_home/away, model_pick, etc.

NOTE: This wires in your RandomForestClassifier saved as final_ats_model.pkl.
For now, we only map 'spread' from the live data. The remaining features are
set to 0 as a temporary fallback â€” replace the TODO section to compute real values.
